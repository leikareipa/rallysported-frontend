                    RallySportED-js is tested primarily in Linux, but should work just as well on Windows.
                    You might find more problems on Apple's operating systems, since the developer has few
                    or no Apple devices to test on.

                    You'll find an option in the top left corner of the RallySportED-js UI's menu bar to
                    download a copy of the current track.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The download will be in the form of a ZIP archive containing the track's assets, as
                    demonstrated below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can reload a saved track file by dragging it onto the RallySportED-js editor view, as
                    described in <a href="#loading-a-track">this topic</a>.
                </p>
            </guide-topic>

            <guide-topic title="Loading tracks">
                <p>
                    There are two ways to load a track for editing or viewing in RallySportED-js: (1) by using a
                    URL parameter, and (2) by dragging a track archive file. The file-dragging method
                    is intended for track files located on your system, while the URL parameter method is
                    for tracks hosted on RallySportED's servers.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The first way is to use a URL parameter. For a demonstration, check out
            
                    <a href="https://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/rallysported/?track=democ">this link</a>.
                    
                    It appends the parameter <em>track</em> to the RallySportED-js URL to indicate that
                    we want to load track #3 of the Rally-Sport demo ("democ" standing for "Demo C").
                    You might use these demo tracks e.g. as a basis for your custom tracks &ndash; being
                    mindful that they're under copyright to someone other than the RallySportED author and
                    have not been licensed for this purpose.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The second way is to drag a track archive file &ndash; which you got e.g. by
                    exporting a track from RallySportED-js as described in <a href="http://localhost:8000/user-guide/#saving-a-track">
                    this topic</a> &ndash; from your system onto the RallySportED-js editor view.
                </p>

            <guide-topic title="The 'Quick share' feature">
                <p>
                    Want to show a track of yours to a friend, but don't want the hassle of sending
                    them a ZIP file? You can use the Serve feature to produce a temporary sharable URL.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    To generate a sharable URL, follow these steps:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Press the "Quick share" button at the top left of the RallySportED-js UI. After a
                    few seconds &ndash; sometimes a bit more &ndash; the button should display the text "Sharing",
                    and your browser's address bar should now contain a <i>transientServer</i> parameter.</li>
                    <li>Copy the address bar link and give it to the people you want
                    to share the track with. When they access this URL, they'll get a copy of the track as
                    it appears in your browser at that moment.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    A few things to keep in mind about quick share:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The sharable URL works only for as long as you've got the RallySportED-js browser
                    tab open and are connected to the internet. If you reload or leave the page, the URL
                    will be invalidated and you need to generate a new one (by again pressing the "Quick
                    share" button).</li>
                    <li>Shared track data is transferred using WebRTC technology directly from your
                    browser to people accessing the URL. The data doesn't pass through a RallySportED server.</li>
                    <li>Any changes you make to the track &ndash; including loading a new track via drag
                    & drop &ndash; will be visible to people when they reload the URL. That is, changes aren't
                    transmitted in real time.</li>
                    <li>Changes made to the track by somebody accessing the shared URL will affect only
                    their local copy, not yours or anybody else's.</li>
                    <li>While sharing is active, the "Quick share" button will display "Sharing (x)", where
                    <i>x</i> is the number of times the shared URL has been accessed.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    To stop sharing, press the "Quick share" button (called "Sharing" while sharing is
                    active) again. The <i>transientServer</i> parameter should disappear from your browser's
                    address bar, and the shared URL will no longer work. If you start sharing again,
                    a new URL will be generated.

            <guide-topic title="Tutorial: Creating a track">
                <p>
                    Here's a runner-downer on how to create a new Rally-Sport track with
                    RallySportED!
                </p>
            
                <h3>
                    Starting out
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    Making a new track with RallySportED always starts with loading in an
                    existing track as a basis. Generally, this will be one of the eight tracks of the
                    Rally-Sport demo.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    So to get started, load in Rally-Sport track #1 by using the <em>track</em> URL
                    parameter, like shown
            
                    <a href="https://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/rallysported/?track=demoa">
                        in this link</a>.
            
                <p>
                    When you direct your browser to that URL, RallySportED-js should load up the
                    track and greet you with a view of something like this:
                </p>
            
                <img src="img/tut-start.png">
            
                <p>
                    When you're ready to start editing, hit the L key on your keyboard to bring up the
                    terrain-leveling prompt. The prompt's visual style will depend on your browser,
                    but it should ask you for a height value to level the terrain to. Enter in '0'
                    and select OK.
                </p>
            
                <img src="img/tut-level-terrain.png">
            
                <p>
                    Having done so, you should be met with a fully flat terrain.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Next, press the A key to bring up the texture-selection pane. It'll pop up on the
                    right-hand side of the screen. In the pane, hover the mouse over the second
                    texture thumbnail (grass) and click the left mouse button. As you do this, a
                    solid yellow rectangle should appear on the thumbnail to indicate that this
                    texture is now selected.
                </p>
            
                <img src="img/tut-pala1.png">
            
                <p>
                    Now press A again to close the texture pane, then Q to open the top-down tilemap
                    view. This is a bird's eye view of the track, useful for laying down large-scale
                    features, like roads. Press the 5 key to
                    select the largest brush size (you'll see a number change on the upper right of
                    the screen to reflect this), then click and hold the middle mouse button while
                    you drag the cursor across the 2D map. You should see the map fill up with green.
                    Fill it up fully, then press the Q key to return to the ground view.
                </p>
            
                <img src="img/tut-paintview.png">
            
                <p>
                    (Note that there will always be a large white pixel visible in the tilemap view
                    that you can't erase. It won't be visible on the actual track; rather, it represents
                    the track's checkpoint &ndash; the point near which your car must pass for the lap to
                    be counted as valid. You'll always want your road to pass over or close to this
                    point, as you can see the game's original tracks doing.)
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Once back in the ground view, move the camera over to the finish line, which looks
                    like the picture below. When you've found it, open the texture pane again (A), and
                    while holding down Tab to see the hovered-over texture thumbnail's index value,
                    select texture #96 (gravel). Set your brush radius to 1 (hit the 1 key). With the
                    middle mouse button, draw a line under the finish line, like in the image below.
                    If you mess up, just hit Ctrl + Z to undo the mistake (Ctrl + Shift + Z redoes
                    it).
                </p>
            
                <img src="img/tut-startmark.png">
            
                <p>
                    When you now open the tilemap view (Q) again, you'll see a lot of green but also
                    a brown horizontal line. This is a temporary visual aid for you that tells you
                    where the finish line is, for when you're laying down the road.

                    While you have the gravel texture (texture #96) selected and the tilemap view
                    open, press the 2 key to get a slightly enlarged brush size, then draw a road
                    onto the map, starting at the finish line, snaking around the area, and winding
                    back at the finish line.

                    Returning to the ground view (Q), you can see that there's now a road going
                    through your scenery. Problem is, the road doesn't look smooth: it has a
                    pixelated, staircasey appearance. To fix this, open the texture pane and look
                    through it. You'll see a bunch of tiles with variously-angled slabs of gravel.
                    With these textures, you can smooth out the edges of your road. It's a bit of manual
                    labor, but suck it up. Below, you can see some 45-degree road tiles having been
                    put down.

                    Decorating the terrain
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    Now that there's a road going on, even if you didn't yet smooth it all out, you
                    can add some surface decorations to make the thing more interesting to drive around on.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The first thing you might do is manipulate the height of the terrain to create
                    hills, dips, and so on. Just use the left and right mouse buttons to rough up the
                    terrain some. Below, I've added some ground details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next bit of detail you might put in are spectators, human models
                    that stand around waving as you drive past. To add them in, open the
                    texture-selection pane (A) and select texture #240. Press G and move the cursor
                    over the ground. You should see a spectator pop up on the tile over which the
                    cursor is hovering. When you apply the texture (middle click), a spectator will
                    be stood there. Experiment with textures #240 and up &ndash; there's bushes and
                    wooden poles in there, too.

                    <b>Tip:</b> If you're not happy with the default Rally-Sport textures, you can
                    hover the cursor over a texture and press the T key to open the texture editor.

                <p>
                    <b>Tip:</b> Any ground tile painted with texture #0 is considered by Rally-Sport a
                    water tile. In-game, water tiles form a smooth surface of a pre-determined height,
                    while the tiles' actual heights determine how deep the water is when driven into. To
                    see water tiles' actual heights in RallySportED-js, use the W key to enable the
                    wireframe mode. To see how the tiles would look in-game, disable the wireframe mode.

                    Testing the track in Rally-Sport
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    Having put in a few bits and bobs, you might want to give the track a
                    test drive. To do that, locate and click the "Download" button at the top left
                    corner of the RallySportED-js page. Your browser should then serve you a ZIP file
                    called DEMOA.ZIP, which contains the data files required to play the track in
                    Rally-Sport.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    If you don't already have the Rally-Sport demo on your computer, you'll need to
                    get it. First, download the desktop version of RallySportED from
                    
                    <a href="http://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/soft/">
                        Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft's website</a>,
                        
                    then extract the RALLYS.ZIP file that comes with it into a folder called
                    C:\\RALLYS (or some other name, this one is just for convenience). Extract the
                    RallySportED files into C:\\RALLYS, as well.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Now that you have Rally-Sport and RallySportED set up, extract the DEMOA.ZIP file
                    into C:\\RALLYS so that the track's files come to be under C:\\RALLYS\\DEMOA\\.
                    Then browse into C:\\RALLYS (in DOS or DOSBox), type "RLOAD DEMOA", and
                    Rally-Sport should launch itself. From the game's main menu, select to start the
                    race.

                <p>
                    From this point on, you'd go back to RallySportED-js to make some changes to the
                    track, test it again in-game to verify that it's still fun to drive, and rinse
                    and repeat until you have a track you don't mind calling finished.

                <h3>
                    Adding an AI opponent
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    One of the things you might notice when you play your new track in Rally-Sport is
                    that the CPU opponent doesn't seem aware of the changes you've made to the track.
                    For instance, it might obliviously keep driving off the road or fail to avoid
                    obstacles you've put in. Well, we can fix this by using the RAI tool that comes
                    with the desktop version of RallySportED (which we installed earlier as part of
                    this tutorial).
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The RAI tool must be run under DOS (or in DOSbox). If you set up the desktop
                    version of RallySportED as described above, you'll already have RAI in
                    C:\\RALLYS. So you can navigate there, enter the command "RAI DEMOA", and now
                    Rally-Sport should pop up in a special "recording" mode.
                </p>
            
                <img src="img/tut-rai-recording.png">
            
                <p>
                    What you're seeing is the same as when you normally play the track in
                    Rally-Sport, but now you have "Recording" written across the bottom of the
                    screen. The gist of this is that RallySportED will record the lap you race
                    and save it as the track's CPU opponent.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So just drive the lap normally, and once the race finishes, press the space key to
                    quit back to the command prompt, where RAI should tell you that it succeeded in
                    creating the new CPU opponent.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The new CPU opponent will have been saved into the track's DTA file under
                    C:\\RALLYS\\DEMOA. You'll want to update the track's ZIP file with the new
                    DTA file, then drag the updated ZIP into RallySportED-js to let it know of the
                    changes. Otherwise, when you save the track again in RallySportED-js, you'd
                    revert back to the original CPU opponent.
