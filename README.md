# RallySportED (web/browser version)
The cult DOS game Rally-Sport (1996) was largely without modding tools&mdash;until RallySportED came along. Released by a third party, i.e. me, on the 20th anniversary of the game, RallySportED allows one to edit many of Rally-Sport's internal assets, like tracks, textures, and certain hard-coded functionality.

To-date, two versions of the game are known to exist. The initial release, in late-1996, is considered a free demo. The second release, in mid-1997, is the full, commercial release, but adds few new features. Since the demo version is not far behind in features and is accessible to a larger number of people, RallySportED targets this version only.

This repo contains the source code for the web/browser version of RallySportED. Note that the repo tracks my local one with low granularity only.

For more information, see the Github repo of the desktop version of RallySportED; and the documentation included with its binary distribution, available from [Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft's website](http://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/soft).

Also see the [live version of RallySportED](http://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/rallysported/) on the web, and the [list of custom tracks](http://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/rallysported/tracklist/) made with it.

### Usage
Verbose instructions to follow, but suffice to say for now that, to test RallySportED on your localhost, use ```localhost/?track=abc``` as the address. This will load the sample track from ```res/tracks/abc.zip```.
